COVID-19 is a new disease that was discovered in December 2019 in humans. It is believed that the virus causing the disease jumped from a wild animal to the human body in a local wildlife meat market in Wuhan in China. Since then, the disease started to spread rapidly, from human to human, in China and neighbouring countries such as South Korea. The epidemic was declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, after reaching tens of countries and leaving hundreds of deaths. As of writing the world counts thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of infections in 180 countries and territories. The continents with the biggest number of infections are Aisa (mainly China, Iran and South Korea), Europe (mainly western Europe) and  the American continents (mainly USA and Brazil).\

The MatLab toolbox we suggest here can help in raising research questions about the efficiency of the lockdown and the closure of aerial spaces. The toolbox enable users to simulate the spatial propagation of the disease and compare different lockdown strategies. Furthermore, our code can be easily extended to take into account finer division of the map of the world. One can divide each continent into countries, each country into regions and each region into zones and then find out best lockdown policies by managing the interconnection between all of them.\
\
This toolbox simplifies the simulation process of the propagation of COVID-19 (or any other viruses) and made the simulation more realistic by taking into account age distribution in different continents as well as long distance travels.\
